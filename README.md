# Introduction {#Introduction}

Fivox (Field Voxelization) is a library to generate volumetric data of
3d scalar fields (Local Field Potential, spikes densities, voltage
sensitive dye), with loaders for the compartment, soma and spike reports
generated by the Neuron and NEST simulators used in the Blue Brain
Project. Fivox supports time animation.

Fivox can be retrieved by cloning
the [source code](ssh://bbpcode.epfl.ch/viz/Fivox).

## Features {#Features}

Fivox provides the following major features:

* Converting compartment reports to volumetric LFP data
* Converting spike reports densities to volumetric data
* Converting compartment and surface area reports to volumetric data
* Time and animation support
