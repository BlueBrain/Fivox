# Introduction {#Introduction}

Fivox is a library to generate volumetric data of 3d scalar fields (Local Field
Potential, spikes densities, VSD) using the compartment, soma and spike reports
generated by the simulator in the Blue Brain Project. Fivox supports time and
voxel densities animation. It is in a very early stage and should only be
considered as an experimental library.

It can be retrieved by cloning
the [source code](ssh://bbpcode.epfl.ch/viz/Fivox).

## Features {#Features}

Fivox provides the following major features:

* Converting compartment reports to volumetric LFP data
* Converting spike reports densities to volumetric data
* Converting compartment and surface area reports to volumetric data
* Time and animation support
