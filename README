0. Requirements
    - doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
    - graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/
    - cmake
    - ccmake
    - boost

1. Make
    CMake(www.cmake.org) is the preferred make tool used in the Blue
    Brain. Its config file is a plain text file called CMakeLists.txt.
    You will find a sample one right next to this README. It is
    commented heavily for reference.

    * Basic use *

    In the top directory, just type "make" and it will do everything for
    you. However, you will need to read the next paragraph if you want
    to customize the build (e.g. enable/disable options)

    * Advanced way *

    To use it run "ccmake Debug" and/or "ccmake Release" in the top
    directory of the project. Then turn on the options that you want.
    For example, you might want to enable building documentation for the
    sample project.  Then press "c" followed by "g" to generate a
    makefile.  Then type "make"

2. Docs

    There is a default doc target in the CMakeLists.txt, which is build
    in as a default target or when you type "make doc" You must have doxygen
    installed on your system for this to work. See hello.h in the
    include directory for hints on how to write doxygen comments.

    Documentation is being placed in: BUILD_DIR/doc

3. Tests

    There are 2 dummy tests defined in the CMakeLists.txt. The unit test
    source is in the test directory.  To run the dummy test, do "make
    test"

4. Project Organization

    Source and header files are grouped by component, namely libs and apps
    (files to build the library, files to build the executable).
